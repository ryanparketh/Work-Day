# Work-Day

## Description
I created each 1 hour time block between 8am and 5pm inside the html file inlcuding a placeholder and add button. In the javascript I added the current date to display at the top of the page, the time of day, local storage to save, and allowing the time to dictate the colour of each box at a given time during the day.
